''' projectile_motion.py
projectile motion equations:
height = y(t) = hs + (t * v * sin(a)) - (g * t*t)/2
distance = x(t) = v * cos(a) * t
where:
t is the time in seconds
v is the muzzle velocity of the projectile (meters/second)
a is the firing angle with repsect to ground (radians)
hs is starting height with respect to ground (meters)
g is the gravitational pull (meters/second_square)
